                    <p class="lead">Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free
                        society,
                        transparency is
                        government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how
                        citizens hold
                        their
                        public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be transparent.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted">Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials
                        conduct the public
                        business and spend
                        taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows
                        good and just
                        governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens about
                        what their
                        Government is doing.</p>
                    <p class="lead">We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement
                        enhances the
                        Government's
                        effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in
                        society, and
                        public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to
                        use our site
                        to
                        become actively engaged in American government.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily
                        find and use.
                        We solicit public
                        feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.</p>

                                    <p class="lead">In the West, the idea that government should be open to public
                                        scrutiny and
                                        susceptible to
                                        public opinion
                                        dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made
                                        an attack
                                        on absolutist
                                        doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The
                                        passage of formal
                                        legislative
                                        instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for
                                        example, (which
                                        then included
                                        Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as part
                                        of its
                                        constitution
                                        (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes
                                        more broadly,
                                        is strongly
                                        related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.

                                    <p class="text-muted">Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in
                                        America (1776) and
                                        France
                                        (1789), freedom of the
                                        press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and
                                        freedom of
                                        the press in
                                        constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean
                                        statesmen to
                                        row back on
                                        these
                                        measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and
                                        writers,
                                        Bentham, Mill
                                        and
                                        Acton prominent among the latter.</p>

                                    <p class="lead">Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary
                                        democratic
                                        practice and
                                        is often linked
                                        to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries
                                        claim to have

                                        first
                                        freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its modern provisions
                                        to the
                                        eighteenth

                                        1917,
                                        passing its Act
